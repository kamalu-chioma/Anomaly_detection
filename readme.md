# AI-Driven Anomaly Detection for Cybersecurity & Financial Fraud  

## Overview  
This project leverages AI and machine learning to detect anomalies in cybersecurity threats and financial fraud. By applying PCA with K-means clustering on network traffic data and Auto-Encoders with t-SNE on transaction data, we improve fraud detection and risk assessment.  

## Key Highlights  
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** PCA + K-means for cybersecurity threats; Auto-Encoders + t-SNE for fraud detection.  
- **Feature Engineering:** PCA reduces noise, improving anomaly detection.  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** K-means clusters suspicious patterns in network traffic.  
- **Deep Learning:** Auto-Encoders extract hidden fraud indicators.  
- **Data Visualization:** t-SNE reveals transaction clusters for risk assessment.  

## Technical Skills  
- **Data Science:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).  
- **AI & Machine Learning:** PCA, K-means, Auto-Encoders, t-SNE.  
- **Cybersecurity & Finance:** Identifying risks through AI-driven models.  

## Methodology  
### **Cybersecurity Threat Detection**  
- **PCA:** Identifies key features in network traffic anomalies.  
- **K-means (EM):** Clusters unusual patterns linked to security threats.  

### **Financial Fraud Detection**
